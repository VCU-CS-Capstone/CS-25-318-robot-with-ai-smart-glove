Training Data: 
This is a labeled dataset that is used to train your machine learning model. It needs to have known inputs 
(features like rotation_x, rotation_y, etc.) and corresponding outputs (the direction labels you're trying to predict). 
The model uses this data to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable (i.e., the direction).

Live_data: 
is used to log the sensor data, but the model needs to be trained with labeled data first.

Training Data Output should be:
    rotation_x,rotation_y,rotation_z,rotation_w,direction
    0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,up
    0.2,0.3,0.1,0.5,down
    0.3,0.1,0.4,0.6,right
